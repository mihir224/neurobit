# neurobit frontend assignment

This is a project that I made as a front-end assignment for [neurobit](https://www.neurobit.com). 

The deployed website can be viewed [here](https://mihir-neurobit.netlify.app/)

I have developed the whole website through the React framework, and have used redux to manage the state of channels mapped by the user ie all of the channels selected will be saved and can be reviewed by the user on the preview page. 
 
Moreover throguh redux, I have also managed the state of the current page so as to fill the progress in the header accordingly. 

Also, I have modified the schema.json file to add options for the channel mapping. 

## To run the project locally on your computer

## clone the repo 

### `git clone https://github.com/mihir224/neurobit`
